Features:

User Input: The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Operation Selection: The user can select the desired operation using a numerical input (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, and 4 for division).
Arithmetic Operations: The program performs the selected operation on the two input numbers.
Result Display: The program displays the result of the operation to the user.

Technologies Used:

Python: The program is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): The program uses a CLI to interact with the user, providing a simple and intuitive interface for input and output.
Conditional Statements: The program uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to control the flow of the program based on user input.
Arithmetic Operators: The program uses arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
Input/Output Functions: The program uses input() and print() functions to interact with the user and display the result of the operation.


Key Insights:

User Input: The program relies on user input for numbers and operation selection, making it interactive and user-friendly.
Conditional Statements: The program uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine the operation to be performed based on user input.
Arithmetic Operations: The program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.
Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling for division by zero, providing a more robust user experience.
Code Readability: The program is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and maintain.

System Requirements:

Python 3.x: The program requires Python 3.x to run.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): The program requires a CLI to interact with the user.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The program requires basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to be performed on two numbers.

Future Enhancements:

Advanced Arithmetic Operations: Add support for advanced arithmetic operations (e.g., exponentiation, logarithms).
Multiple Numbers: Allow users to input multiple numbers and perform operations on them.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Create a GUI version of the program for a more user-friendly interface.
